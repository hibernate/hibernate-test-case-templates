/**
 * HHH-7973:
 * When calling Session.createQuery() with the query string
 * FROM Phase WHERE Comment = 'This is a test, Phase 1'
 * it is turned into
 * FROM com.example.Phase WHERE Comment = 'This is a test, com.example.Phase 1'
 * as shown by log output in the QueryTranslatorImpl.
 * This is, to put it mildly, highly surprising and undesirable behaviour.
 * The trigger seems to be the sequence <Comma Space Entity-Name>, which
 * triggers a transformation of the entity name into the fully qualified class
 * name even in string literals, where that has no business happening
 * whatsoever.
